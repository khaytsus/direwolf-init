# Determine the PPM from an rtl_power csv file
# Command line arguments are as follows
#  ppm - ppm used for rtl_power run
#  target - target frequency we're using to find a peak on
#  file - csv file output by rtl_power
#  terse - set to 1 to output only ppm value

# Example:  Use 162.400 as that's a strong NOAA channel and it's stable
# rtl_power -c .1 -f 162.39M:162.41M:64 -i 2 -g 10 -p 80 -e 10m noaa.csv
# findppm.pl 80 162400000 noaa.csv
# Output:  Best PPM is 63
# Output verified in gqrx is 63.
# For terse output, set terse to 1, output will just be the numeric ppm
#  for use in scripts
